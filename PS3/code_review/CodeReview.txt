Suggestions:
In StopwatchFactory line 18 and 52, and in StopwatchImpl line 19 : one doesn't have to specify the
type of Collection in assignment.

(I) In StopwatchImpl.java :
i.    Line 42,47,58,70,81,92,99 proper java documentation missing. @inheritDoc must be used.
ii.   Line 19 lap times should be final.
iii.  Line 21 enum should be final.
iv.   Line 26 lock object should be final.
v.    Line 106 to Line 116 are not needed because it was decided since each stopwatch instance is
unique equals and hash code are not needed.
vii.  Line 33 constructor should be package private and not public so that it's not accessible
outside the package without StopwatchFactory.
viii. As was directed once the stopwatch is started after being stopped it should seem like it was
never stooped. That is the stop time recorded should be removed from stopwatch. This doesn't happen.
ix.   A private method that is one line and does nothing extra is not needed.
x.    Line 94 a mutex lock is not needed and multiple threads should be able read the list
simultaneously in the current return form.
xi.   Line 95 we shouldn't return the list where we store data but a copy of the same or
manipulating the list from the outside will break the stopwatch. The mutex lock also is necessary in
this case.
xii.  Line 101 mutex lock is not needed as several threads should be able to get the toString of a
thread safe object simultaneously until one is reading from a list.

(II) In StopwatchFactory.java :
i.   At line 36, the contains check should be inside the mutex lock as two threads containing same
id may pass the contains check and then reach the mutex lock. Both of them will then add stopwatches
with same id to the map. This makes the expected functionality incorrect.
ii.  Both mutex and stopwatchMap should be final.
iii. Line 33, id composed of all spaces is an empty id and hence should be handled accordingly.
iv.  toString method missing in the class.
v.   Line 18, the type of stopwatchMap should be Map we don't need the implementation info in
declaration.
