General:
i.    No easy mechanism for version handling.
ii.   All the services(operations) are in one class so if one want's to change how these are
implemented then they will have to overwrite the class.
iii.  Search doesn't work exactly as is in a common address book.

(I) In StopwatchImpl.java :
i.    Line 42,47,58,70,81,92,99 proper java documentation missing. inheritDoc must be used.
ii.   Line 19 lap times should be final.
iii.  Line 21 enum should be final.
iv.   Line 26 lock object should be final.
v.    Line 106 to Line 116 as was decided since each stopwatch instance is unique equals and hash
code are not needed.
vii.  Line 33 constructor should be package private and not public so that it's not accessible
outside the package without StopwatchFactory.
viii. As was directed once the stopwatch is started after being stopped it should seem like it was
never stooped. That is the stop time recorded should be removed from stopwatch. This doesn't happen.
ix.   A private method that is one line and does nothing extra is not needed.
x.    Line 94 a mutex lock is not needed and multiple threads should be able read the list
simultaneously.
xi.   Line 95 we shouldn't return the list where we store data but a copy of the same or
manipulating the list from the outside will break the stopwatch.
xii.  Line 101 mutex lock is not needed as several threads should be able to get the toString of a
thread safe object simultaneously.

(II) In StopwatchFactory.java :
i.    toString methods missing.
ii.   JavaDoc is not properly maintained. The parameters and return values are not properly
specified for all public methods (eg. line 85, 77, 89, 117-118, 101, 129, etc).
iii.  Getters are not descriptive hence one isn't aware what is the default value.
iv.   No null checks.
v.    Entries are not final and hence mutable.
vi.   No JavaDoc for entry builder so user is not aware of the arguments and details he can pass,
 their default values and their usage.
vii.  Line 57 should return primitive (int) as null is never returned.
viii. The signature of address method in EntryBuilder is really bulky. Should use builder pattern
more efficiently.
